    "\n",
    "Gaussian-Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAE ; [Fortuin et. al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04155.pdf)) is an approach developed for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. It combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian Processes (GPs) in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep VAEs are used to map the original time series data with missing values into a latent space.\n",
    "- A GP then utilizes latent representations to capture the temporal correlations in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of this is available in [Fortuin et. al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04155.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our use case, we wish to use the latent space of the GP-VAE as features for the light curves in 6 passbands. We use code provided by the authors on [GitHub](https://github.com/ratschlab/GP-VAE)<sup>[*](#myfootnote1)</sup>.\n",

    "<a name=\"myfootnote1\">*</a> Note: The original code was based on TensorFlow 1.15 and so we made small modifications on a [fork](https://github.com/siddharthchaini/GP-VAE) using [TensorFlow's Upgrade Script](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/upgrade) to make it compatible for TensorFlow 2+."
